## Project Title: Grid Solving Autonomous Sorting Robot

The objective of the overall problem statement is to create a multi agent sorting robot, that can handle multiple sources and multiple destinations. My contribution to this project is to create a micro ROS client that runs on an ESP32 and can communicate with the ROS2 server wirelessly. 

### Components and hardware used:
- ESP32
- RS485 to ttl Converter
- Leadshine CS2RS-D507 Stepper Motor Driver
- Leadshine CS-M22331-L Closed Loop Stepper Motor
- ZLAC8015 AC Servo Motor Driver

### Tech Stack used:
- ROS2
- Micro ROS
- Arduino IDE
- Platform IO
- MODBUS
- RS485
